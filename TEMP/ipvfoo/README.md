IPvFoo is a Chrome extension that adds an icon to your location bar, indicating whether the current page was fetched using IPv4 or IPv6. When you click the icon, a pop-up appears, listing the IP address for each domain that served the page elements.

Everything is captured privately using the webRequest API (new in Chrome 17), without creating any additional network traffic.

#### Install it from the Chrome Web Store:

#### Firefox Port:
There exists an IPvFoo-like extension for Firefox named [IPvFox](https://github.com/Dagger0/IPvFox).  It's based on the same images, but is otherwise an independent project.
